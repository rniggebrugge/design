EJ WEBSITE BACK END

- integration with dms, vacancy notices, publications, etc.
- possibility to import articles, images, etc., using templates?
- possibility to export assets
- advanced search options
- batch processing (on items found by search)

Slide 5
- possibility to choose for static (predefined) and dynamic lists
- filter/sorter for dynamic lists should be editable. Multiple engines can be maintained and selected where required
- mass file upload + mass processing: resizing, cropping and other (image)processing. Using "templates" to reuse processing steps
- automatically generated ids, plus semi-automatic public ids based on document properties (public/private, category, etc.)

Slide 6:
- open/closed taxonomy. Who controls, manages taxonomy?
- what's meant with "workflow for publications but..."?
- is final approval manager part of the back-end, or communicated (by email, phone, etc.) by manager to website administrator? 

Slide 7:
- this idea is very close to the Monitoring Tool EJN will have for website:
   what countries did update (implication: what countries did not?)
   For EJN site: a change in status of implementation of instrument I by country C will have implications for certain areas of the Atlas for that country.
- how are the rules defined and managed? Relations between pages, or also other assets? Could imagine change to document (like adoption of EJ regulation) has implications for many pages.

Slide 8:
- publishing items on Twitter directly from back end. Who can do this?

Slide 9:
- time spent on site, pages consulted, documents downloaded
- how is content reached, how do people enter the site
- some demographics
