EJ WEBSITE BACK END

- integration with dms, vacancy notices, publications, etc.
- possibility to import articles, images, etc., using templates?
- possibility to export assets
- advanced search options
- batch processing (on items found by search)

Slide 5
- possibility to choose for static (predefined) and dynamic lists
- filter/sorter for dynamic lists should be editable. Multiple engines can be maintained and selected where required
- mass file upload + mass processing: resizing, cropping and other (image)processing. Using "templates" to reuse processing steps
- automatically generated ids, plus semi-automatic public ids based on document properties (public/private, category, etc.)

Slide 6:
- open/closed taxonomy. Who controls, manages taxonomy?
- what's meant with "workflow for publications but..."?
- is final approval manager part of the back-end, or communicated (by email, phone, etc.) by manager to website administrator? 

Slide 7:
- this idea is very close to the Monitoring Tool EJN will have for website:
   what countries did update (implication: what countries did not?)
   For EJN site: a change in status of implementation of instrument I by country C will have implications for certain areas of the Atlas for that country.
- how are the rules defined and managed? Relations between pages, or also other assets? Could imagine change to document 
(like adoption of EJ regulation) has implications for many pages.

Slide 8:
- publishing items on Twitter directly from back end. Who can do this?

Slide 9:
- time spent on site, pages consulted, documents downloaded, returning visitors, visits (per visitor) per month/year
- how is content reached, how do people enter the site
- some demographics (who, where from)
- what would be considered "good statistics", keeping in mind the possible audiences for a dedicated site like Eurojust

Slide 10:
- good to have access to templates and stylesheets and not to depend on (external) developer
- manager has final approval right for publication, but other, far-reaching permissions I guess
- should css/templates be moved to administrator?
- what is "create and change forms", is this the creation and editing of asset types?

Slide 11:
- presumbly the vpn is concidered extension of the EJ Office network. People can still work remotely, good thing
- tracibility, accountability
- protected areas of the website? If so, how is access granted and managed?

Slide 12:
- easy to set up, difficult to maintain (content wise)
- good to use these tools.

Slide 13:

Slide 14:

Slide 15:
- what are requirements of website itself?
- can tree jack be explained, I think it relates to how findable items are and thus how intuitive the structure of the site is.
- if possible I would like to stay involved

Slide 16: 
- also adaptibility can be considered:
	- do we want things to be changed easily?
	- changes to content are obvious
	- changes to design as well
	
Slide 17:
- on slide 15 there's talk of sample website and design, but this should be done after the wireframes...
- IM-OP and BBM to work on wireframe, why not also involving others? It's not technical, nor requires artistic talent.
- are ICT Security and DP also concerned about what can seen in back end?

Slide 18:

Slide 19:
Slide 20:
is launch planned for 2019 or, judging from the graph, at some point in near future after 2019?
